🚗 Car Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the selling price of cars based on various features such as brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation using Python.

📌 Project Overview

Accurately estimating a car’s price is essential for both buyers and sellers. This project uses historical car data to build a predictive model that estimates car prices using regression techniques.

🧠 Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature engineering
Machine Learning model training
Model evaluation and comparison
Price prediction for new data

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn
📊 Machine Learning Models Used

Linear Regression
(Optional) Random Forest Regressor
(Optional) Decision Tree Regressor
Model selection is based on performance metrics such as R² score and Mean Absolute Error.

📈 Results

The model provides reasonably accurate price predictions.
Performance improves with feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.

🔮 Future Improvements

Deploy model using Flask or FastAPI
Add more features (location, ownership history)
Perform hyperparameter tuning
Use advanced models like XGBoost
